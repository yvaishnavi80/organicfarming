    <img src="services.jpg" alt="Organic Farming Image 1">
    <p>At Organic Farming, we offer a range of services designed to promote sustainable agriculture and provide our
        community with fresh, organic produce. Our commitment to environmental stewardship and ethical farming
        practices sets us apart. Here are some of the services we provide:</p>
  
      <h3>Crop Cultivation</h3>
      <p>We specialize in organic crop cultivation, carefully selecting and nurturing a variety of crops using
        sustainable and natural farming methods. Our goal is to produce high-quality, nutrient-rich crops without
        compromising the health of the soil or the environment.</p>
  
      <h3>Pest Control</h3>
      <p>Our approach to pest control is rooted in ecological balance. We implement integrated pest management (IPM)
        strategies, combining natural predators, companion planting, and other organic techniques to minimize the impact
        of pests on our crops without resorting to synthetic pesticides.</p>
  
      <h3>Sustainable Farming Practices</h3>
      <p>Embracing sustainable farming is at the core of our philosophy. We implement practices such as cover cropping,
        crop rotation, and water conservation to promote soil health, reduce environmental impact, and ensure the
        long-term viability of our farming operations.</p>
  
      <p>By choosing Organic Farming, you are supporting a sustainable and responsible approach to agriculture. We are
